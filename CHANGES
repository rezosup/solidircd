15/05/2005 - Disabled multiple buffer support for iovecs for ssl are impractical. 
found in ssl engine:
/*
 * There is no SSL_writev() provided by OpenSSL. The reason is mainly because
 * OpenSSL has to fragment the data itself again for the SSL record layer, so a
 * writev() like interface makes not much sense.  What we do is to emulate it
 * to at least being able to use the write() like interface. But keep in mind
 * that the network I/O performance is not write() like, of course.
 */
