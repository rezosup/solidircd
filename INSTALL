HOW TO BUILD:
------------- 
1.  Run the configure script.  It will setup include/setup.h and the
    Makefiles to match your system:
	./configure

   To build with Client SSL support disabled use ./configure --disable-openssl

    Type ./configure --help to see different options.  Most people will not
    need to alter these.

2.  Edit the the "include/config.h" file.  This allows you to 
    change various options of how the ircd will operate. Usually the defaults
    are OK.

3.  "make" should build ircd.

4.  "make install" will install the ircd, config converter, and documents
    to the directory set by ./configure

5.  Edit template.conf in your install directory, and move it to "ircd.conf".

6.  Run the binary!  ircd will look in the directory you are executing from
    for an ircd.conf first, then it will look to the directory local to itself.
    You may override these options by specifying a config file using:
    ./ircd -f path/to/ircd.conf

Best of luck!
