/*
 * The services and stats IRC server names are used for the shortform
 * commands, which are transformed into targeted name@server messages for
 * security.  The services server name is used by SERVICES, IDENTIFY,
 * NICKSERV, CHANSERV, MEMOSERV, ROOTSERV, NS, CS, MS, and RS.  The stats
 * server name is used by OPERSERV, STATSERV, HELPSERV, OS, SS, and HS.
 * >> defaults: services.dal.net, stats.dal.net
 * 
 * The staff_address token is used for operator hostmasking, as described
 * in the Allow block documentation.
 * >> default: staff.dalnet
 * 
 * The nshelpurl token is used to supply a URL for nick registration help.
 * It is sent to clients in the rejection numeric when they encounter a +R
 * channel and are not registered.
 * >> default: http://docs.dal.net/docs/nsemail.html
 * 
 * The maxchannels token limits the number of channels a user may join at
 * one time.  The limit for server operators is 3x this one.
 * >> default: 10
 * 
 * The server type changes some behavior to be appropriate to the role.
 * CLIENT servers can only link to one other server (their uplink hub).
 * HUB servers link several servers together, but are not intended to hold
 * general users.  The SERVICESHUB type enables some optimizations for
 * directly-connected services; it requires special services support and
 * should not be used in other cases.
 * >> default: CLIENT
 * 
 * The server is capable of sending a set of notices to users on connect,
 * providing some information about a proxy bot that scans them.  The
 * wgmonhost token is the host the bot will be connecting from (for users
 * with firewalls or other connection monitoring), and wgmonurl is a web
 * page containing additional information about the bot.  If neither token
 * is specified, the notices will not be sent.
 * 
 * Proper clock synchronization is required among connected servers.  This
 * requirement can be relaxed by using the ts_warn_delta and ts_max_delta
 * tokens.  The TS delta is the difference (in seconds) between the clocks
 * of this server and the one it is linked to.  These options should only
 * be used as a last resort; the correct fix for TS delta problems is to
 * synchronize the clocks on both server computers, such as with the ntpdate
 * tool.  Unsynchronized clocks may cause unpredictable network problems.
 * >> defaults: 15, 120
 * 
 * The local_clones and global_clones tokens control the maximum number of
 * connections the server will allow from the same place by default.  The
 * first number refers connections from the same IP (10.0.0.5).  This number
 * may optionally be followed by a colon ':' and a second number, which
 * refers to connections from the same site (10.0.0.*).  The local_clones
 * token sets the default limits for connections on this server only, and
 * may be overridden by the maxclones token in a Class block.  The
 * global_clones token sets the default limits for connections as seen on
 * the entire network, and may be overridden by network services.
 * >> defaults: 10:60, 25:150
 * 
 * The crypt_oper_pass token configures the server to use hashed passwords
 * in the Oper blocks, to avoid password discovery by someone reading the
 * conf file.  If this token is specified, passwords in the Oper blocks
 * must be generated by the tools/mkpasswd utility.
 * 
 * The short_motd token enables use of the ircd.smotd file, which is sent
 * to clients on connect instead of ircd.motd.  The MOTD command still sends
 * the contents of ircd.motd as normal.  This option is intended to reduce
 * traffic on connect, but still convince users to read the full motd when
 * appropriate.
 * 
 * The show_links token causes the LINKS command to display real server
 * links (though Super servers are still hidden).  If this token is not
 * specified, LINKS will display the list given to it by services.
 * 
 * The allow_split_ops token causes the server to always give chanop status
 * to users who join empty channels, even when no other servers are linked.
 * Normally op status will not be given when this server is alone, to help
 * prevent channel abuse during netsplits.  This token should be used if
 * your server is not part of a network.  Opers are always given op status
 * in empty channels regardless of this setting.
 * 
 * All of these tokens are optional, and can be specified at different times
 * in multiple Options blocks.  If a token is specified twice, the second
 * value overrides the first.

/* Client Side SSL 
 * Issues to note...
 * Information you exchange with an IRC server over a secure connection can not be viewed or changed by others. 
 * However, be aware that traffic between public servers on a network is exchanged over plain, open unencrypted lines. 
 * This means that if you want to be sure that your communication is secure, you and the person with whom you want to 
 * communicate securely should both connect to the same SSL-capable server, and communicate via a query window. 
 * If talking on a channel, be aware that everyone on the channel must be on a secure connection 
 * If one person on the channel is not on a secure connection, your communications on that channel will not be secure.
 * 
 * Channel mode (+S) Only Allows secure connections to access the channel.
 *
 * To create your SSL certificate run the /makecert.sh  file in ircd/ssl/

};


/*
 * Idle connections are polled with the PING command every pingfreq seconds.
 * 
 * The maxsendq token controls the size of the internal send buffer, used
 * when a connection cannot accept large amounts of data at once.  Certain
 * server commands emit such large amounts of data.  As an example metric,
 * a 100KB user send queue can support a WHO <channel> query for a channel
 * with approximately 700 users.  Large amounts of data are also generated
 * when two servers link and synchronize network state.  If the send queue
 * limit is exceeded, the connection is terminated.
 * 
 * For classes used in the Allow blocks, the maxusers token limits the
 * number of clients that may exist in this class.  This is the most common
 * general user limit for the server.  If this limit is reached, additional
 * clients will be rejected with a "server busy" message.  This token must
 * not be specified for classes used in the Connect blocks.
 * 
 * For classes used in the Allow blocks, the maxclones token limits the
 * number of clients that may connect from the same place in this class.
 * The first number refers to connections from the same IP (10.0.0.5); it
 * may be optionally followed by a colon ':' and a second number, which
 * refers to connections from the same site (10.0.0.*).  If this limit is
 * reached, clients will be rejected with a "too many connections from your
 * host/site" message.  Limits defined here override the defaults as
 * configured in the Options block.  If a site limit is not supplied here,
 * clients in this class will effectively have no site limit; the default
 * limit will not be used.  This token must not be specified for classes
 * used in the Connect blocks.
 * 
 * For classes used in the Connect blocks, the connfreq token specifies the
 * frequency at which autoconnections are tried.  This token works together
 * with maxlinks, which specifies the maximum number of servers in this
 * class to autoconnect to.  For an autoconnection to take place, the
 * Connect block must have a valid port token, and there must be less than
 * maxlinks connected servers in this class.  The connfreq and maxlinks
 * tokens must not be specified for classes used in the Allow or Oper
 * blocks.
 * 
 * A "default" class is created internally using definitions in config.h.

/*
 * The server uses a default-deny policy for incoming connections; at least
 * one Allow block must be supplied if you wish to use your server.
 * 
 * The host and ipmask tokens specify which connections this block matches.
 * The server always performs DNS and ident lookups for connections.  If DNS
 * cannot find a hostname, the IP is used instead.  If ident cannot get a
 * valid response, "unknown" is used during this stage.  The client's
 * resolved hostname, IP address, ident reply, and username (from the USER
 * line) are used according to the results of the matches described below.
 * 
 * The host token attempts to match first against the resolved hostname if
 * available, then against the IP address.  To include the connection's
 * ident response in the match, use a mask in the form "ident@host".  If a
 * client matches this token, it appears on IRC using its resolved hostname.
 * 
 * The ipmask token attempts to match against the IP address only.  To
 * include the connection's ident response in the match, use a mask in the
 * form "ident@host".  If a client matches this token, it appears on IRC
 * using its IP address, even if its hostname was resolved.
 * 
 * If the matching mask used ident ("ident@host" instead of "host"), and no
 * ident response was received from the client, it appears on IRC with its
 * username prefixed with '~'.  If the matching mask used only the "host"
 * form, the client's username is not prefixed.  If a valid ident response
 * was received, it is always used (without prefix), regardless of the mask
 * form.
 * 
 * Only one of the host and ipmask tokens is needed; if both are used, host
 * is matched first.  For typical configurations, using only the host token
 * with a "*@host" or "ident@host" mask is recommended.
 * 
 * Examples:
 *     // client with username "user", ident "ident", hostname "name"
 *     host ident@*;     # appears as ident@name
 *     ipmask *;         # appears as ident@10.0.0.1
 * 
 *     // same client without ident response
 *     host *;           # appears as user@name
 *     host *@*;         # appears as ~user@name
 *     ipmask unknown@*; # appears as ~user@10.0.0.1
 * 
 * The port token limits this block to match connections to the specified
 * port only.
 * 
 * The passwd token requires that matching connections supply a password to
 * use the server.  Clients can send a password string in multiple forms,
 * depending on which passwords need to be used.  The basic format is:
 * 
 *     [passwd][:][opername:operpass][:][nickpass]
 * 
 * If the Allow block requires a password, it must be supplied at the front
 * of the string.  If operator hostmasking is enabled (via the flags token
 * described below), the client can mask itself by supplying a "name:passwd"
 * string as defined in an Oper block.  When masked, a client appears on IRC
 * using the Oper block name for its ident, and the Options block
 * staff_address for its hostname.  Any remaining passwords are sent to
 * NickServ in an SIDENTIFY command.  All password components must be
 * separated from each other by a ':' colon.
 * 
 * Using the examples in this file, a client could connect with the password
 * string "secret:johndoe:secret" and be masked as johndoe@staff.net.
 * 
 * The flags token allows special behavior to be assigned to this
 * connection, using a set of single-letter options.  The available flags
 * are:
 * 
 *     m  Enable operator hostmasking
 *     C  Bypass clone limiting
 *     F  Force umode +F to bypass message flood checks
 *     T  Disable rapid (re)connection throttling
 * 
 * When operator hostmasking is enabled, a matching client can connect using
 * a special password to be masked, as described for the passwd token above.
 * 
 * Normally all clients are subjected to a clone limit check when they
 * connect, as configured in the Options and Class blocks.  The C flag skips
 * this check for matching clients, allowing them to have an unrestricted
 * number of connections.
 * 
 * The F flag forces matching clients to always have usermode +F, to avoid
 * various message flood checks.  This flag is intended for special bots and
 * should not be used for server operators; opers can make use of the F
 * access flag as described in the Oper block documentation.
 * 
 * By default, the server throttles rapid (re)connections from a single IP
 * address, to help reduce abuse and load.  The T flag disables this
 * mechanism for matching clients.  To qualify, a client must send valid
 * NICK and USER messages to register the connection, and stay connected
 * long enough to complete the ident and DNS lookups.  However, a correct
 * password is not required.
 *
 * The class token specifies the connection Class to place matching
 * connections in.  If not specified, the default class is used; see the
 * Class block description for details.
 * 
 * There may be multiple Allow blocks; they are matched in the order they
 * appear.

 * 
 * CIDR format is the most efficient, and should be used when possible.  The
 * server will attempt to convert wildcard IP masks to CIDR form internally.
