New - solid-ircd 3.4.7(stable)
------------------------------


User Modes & Oper Modes Changes
---------------------------------
User mode +Y (Deaf Mode)
Opermode (+W) Will hide servers & channels on ircop's whois from normal users.
Whois notice has been merged with (+y)



Core Changes
------------------
Elmer has been fully implemented on this release
Readded G-line
GCC4 compatible.
Readded FREEZE from solid-ircd2.2.20(Freeze works like shun, when set the user will not be 
able to send text to the channel, if the user reconnects when freeze is set, it will wear off,
this was readded for the purpose of saving some time, its quicker than setting shun, since freeze
is simply set by doing /freeze nick)
